Compared with the `api.getRsbuildConfig` method, the config returned by this method has been normalized, and the type definition of the config will be narrowed. For example, the `undefined` type of `config.html` will be removed.

It is recommended to use this method to get the Rsbuild config.

- **Type:**

```ts
/** Get the Rsbuild configuration of the specified environment */
function GetNormalizedConfig(options: {
  environment: string;
}): Readonly<NormalizedEnvironmentConfig>;

/** Get all Rsbuild configurations */
function GetNormalizedConfig(): Readonly<NormalizedConfig>;
```
