# Announcing Rsbuild 0.6

> April 10, 2024

Rsbuild 0.6 has been released along with Rspack 0.6!

Notable changes:

- Upgrade to Rspack 0.6
- Error overlay enabled by default
- Support for Vue JSX HMR
- New transform plugin API
- Default port changed to 3000

## Upgrade to Rspack 0.6

Rsbuild has upgraded the dependent Rspack to version 0.6, and adapted the breaking changes of CSS Modules contained in Rspack 0.6.

In the new version, Rspack has enabled the new tree shaking algorithm by default, resulting in a significant improvement in bundle size and artifact stability. Please refer to the [Rspack 0.6 release announcement](https://rspack.dev/blog/announcing-0-6) to learn more.

## Error overlay enabled by default

Starting from Rsbuild 0.6, the default value of [dev.client.overlay](/config/dev/client) has been adjusted to `true`. This means that when a compilation error occurs, Rsbuild will pop up the error overlay by default to display the error information:

If you do not need this feature, you can set `dev.client.overlay` to `false` to disable it.

```ts title="rsbuild.config.ts"
export default defineConfig({
  dev: {
    client: {
      overlay: false,
    },
  },
});
```

## Support for Vue JSX HMR

`@rsbuild/plugin-vue-jsx` now supports JSX HMR. When you modify JSX code in a Vue 3 application, it will automatically trigger hot module replacement and preserve the current page state.

This feature is implemented by community contributor [@liyincode](https://github.com/liyincode) ❤️, and released as a standalone package [babel-plugin-vue-jsx-hmr](https://github.com/liyincode/babel-plugin-vue-jsx-hmr), for use in projects outside of Rsbuild.

## Default port changed to 3000

Rsbuild has changed the default value of [server.port](/config/server/port) from `8080` to `3000`.

Port 3000 is commonly used for web development, and is also the default port used by tools such as create-react-app. Changing the default port to 3000 can prevent possible port conflicts when using 8080.

If you need to use port 8080, you can manually set it as follows:

```ts title="rsbuild.config.ts"
export default defineConfig({
  server: {
    port: 8080,
  },
});
```
